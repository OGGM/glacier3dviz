    "# Welcome to the OGGM:3D-Viz Tutorials!\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks will help you learn how to use the OGGM:3D-Viz tool to visualize changes in glaciers dynamically. Before you start the tutorials, please set up a conda/mamba environment using this [environment.yml](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-3dviz/blob/main/environment.yml) file. You can find instructions on how to do this in the [conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). After creating your conda environment you can install OGGM:3D-Viz in your terminal with the lines\n",

    "```\n",
    "conda activate oggm-3dviz\n",
    "pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-3dviz.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find a bug or would like to add a new feature to OGGM:3D-Viz we are happy to help, just reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-3dviz). If you are interested in glacier modeling on a large scale, consider joining the [OGGM slack channel](https://oggm.org/2022/10/11/Welcome-to-the-OGGM-Slack/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool uses the [PyVista library](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/), which is excellent for 3D visualizations. If you use visuals created with OGGM-3D-Viz in your scientific work, please consider citing `PyVista`. You can find how to cite it on their website [here](https://pyvista.org/cite/).\n",

    "1. [Getting Started with OGGM:3D-Viz](getting_started.ipynb)\n",
    "   - Understand the format of the input data.\n",
    "   - Learn how to create your first 3D visualization object.\n",
    "   - Explore how to display interactive plots, create animations, or make static plots.\n",
    "2. [General Styling of 3D Visualizations](general_styling.ipynb)\n",
    "   - Adjust the size of the figure.\n",
    "   - Modify lighting settings.\n",
    "   - Change the background color.\n",
    "   - Set the point of view.\n",
    "   - Choose colors for ice thickness and topography (including the use of satellite data).\n",
    "3. [Annotating Your 3D Glacier Visualizations](annotations.ipynb)\n",
    "   - Add arrow annotations (e.g., for a north arrow).\n",
    "   - Place point annotations (e.g., labeling a peak).\n",
    "   - Create outline annotations (e.g., show the extent of a glacier in the past).\n",
    "   - Include legend annotations (e.g., add a legend).\n",
