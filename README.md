The OGGM:3D-Viz tool helps you make 3D visualizations of changing glaciers. It's mostly made using the great [PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) package and designed for working with [OGGM](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm) data. But you can also use it for showing any glacier data, no matter how you got it.

To begin and learn how to use OGGM:3D-Viz, take a look at the tutorials. They'll get you started and teach you how to use the tool.
